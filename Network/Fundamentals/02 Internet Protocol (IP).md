 IP is the address for host to host communication along with MAC address. It's the data that Layer 3 handles with packets, represented as **network.host/subnet** foramt.
- If destination ip resides in the same subnet, it only uses MAC address(L2) for communication
- If not, packet(L3) is delivered to the Default Gateway(Router)
